        <p className="bio">
          Entering SFSU, I planed on majoring in Mathmatics, until I took a computer class. There is no other relief than when a 
          program is running succefully, but I am eager to find ways to make my program better. When I am free I enjoy being around my
          family, or playing basketball. Before COVID-19, I would travel to different beaches to relax my mind.  <br></br>
          <br></br>
          My motto in life is "go with the flow". Even though I try to live stress-free, I still have goals. After completing 
          my bachelor in computer science, I plan on continuing school until I acheive my doctoral degree. Coming from a first generation 
          family, I was tought that knowledge is key. Teaching the ones after me would be a blessing.
